My-Garage-iOS
=============

[Arduino Garage Control](https://github.com/piejanssens/Garage-Control-Arduino) companion app for Siri - "Open 'My Garage'"

[Watch it in action!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utPfQMeuSUI)

This app will open connect to the device, send the command to switch the relay and close. 
Can be used to quickly switch the garage door, but above all in combination with Siri: "Open my garage"!!

Use cocoapods to install the dependency.

!Important! 
Store your BLE Shield UUID in the BLEDefines.h file.
Use an example BLE app from the appstore to check your UUID or check the XCode logs when you run it in debug on the device.
